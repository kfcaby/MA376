```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

#read in the data
houses = read_csv(file = "redfin_2019-08-22-04-53-45.csv")

```

Let $x = y + 5$

## Step 1. Ask a Research Question

What are major factors affecting houses prices in Cornwall?

## Step 2. Design a Study and Collect Data

Let's do some data analysis
```{r}
houses %>% group_by(CITY) %>% summarise(mean(PRICE), 
                     median(PRICE),
                     sd(PRICE), n())
```

Here are some descriptive plots

```{r}
houses %>% filter(PRICE < 1000000) %>% ggplot(aes(x = PRICE, fill = CITY)) + geom_histogram()

houses %>% ggplot(aes(x = `SQUARE FEET`, 
                      y = PRICE,
                      color = `PROPERTY TYPE`)) + geom_point()

```

Here, we will fit a linear model to the data.

```{r}
houses %>% ggplot(aes(x = `SQUARE FEET`, y = PRICE)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

linear_model = lm(PRICE ~ `SQUARE FEET`, data = houses)
summary(linear_model)

residuals = residuals(linear_model)
hist(residuals)
```
